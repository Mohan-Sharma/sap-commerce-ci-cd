- [SonarQube Scanner](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/) - This plugin allow easy integration of SonarQubeâ„¢, the open source platform for Continuous Inspection of code quality.
- [Job DSL](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/) -  The Job DSL plugin attempts to solve this problem by allowing jobs to be defined in a programmatic form in a human readable file.

1. To start using this project create a pipeline Job in Jenkins which will act as the seeder job. Pipeline can be configured as below. Once this job is ran manually, this will create 2 new jobs -

      1. One for every PR quality check 
      2. One for build and deploy to CCv2
2. In order to use these 2 job, you need to place the right SAP Commerce artifact in `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` check `extractCommerce.groovy` for details.
3. If any change is required on these jobs, don't change it manually instead use this repository to make the changes and run the seeder job again.
